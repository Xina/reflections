How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The bug was spotted much easily compared to viewing both codes one line at a time.
All the differences can be clearly seen. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Review the changes made and understand where the problems are. This prevents from making the same mistake in the future.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
It is easy to forget to commit and this may cause me to losetrack of the changes made.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Files saved are of different types

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log helps me see the commits and review the changes made. Git diff helps me to compare the changes between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I am able to pinpoint the version in which a big was introduced.

How do I want to use Git?
To commit my changes in code and track the changes.
